## About The Project

## Getting Started

### Project Assignement
---
Consider the classical Traveling Salesman Problem, several instances and several solutions also for the same instance. Consider short sub-sequences in the solutions and define an ML method aimed to recognize good and bad sequences. Implement a simple greedy algorithm whose choices are guided by the ‘scores’ given by the ML.
